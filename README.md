    - WA and TLE on A: lack caution manipulating the **pointer**, when the chain is empty, make the tail pointer point to -1 and keep head pointer unchange.
* 2016.08.04 CF365 Div.2
    - RE on B: insufficient **size of array**.
    - TLS on B: not realize the **property of** distribution on multiplication in **the problem**.
    - WA on C: stupid mistake, forgot to **set the precision in special cases**.
    - TLE on D: sort the pair vector costs lots of time. If want to sort intervals by one point, use **vector** to store **links on each point** is a good choice.
